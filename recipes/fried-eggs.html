    <p>Brown chicken eggs</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
         </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small small nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Break eggs, 1 at a time, into pan; reduce heat to low. Cook slowly until whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken.</li>
        <li>For eggs sunny-side up, cover pan and cook until yolks thicken, but are not hard. For basted eggs, spoon butter in pan over eggs while cooking. For over-easy eggs, carefully turn eggs to cook both sides but do not cover pan.</li>
    </ol>
